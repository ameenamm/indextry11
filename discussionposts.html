       <p>  assigned reading 2: <a href="https://www.jacobinmag.com/2018/06/github-microsoft-open-source-code-technology"> https://www.jacobinmag.com/2018/06/github-microsoft-open-source-code-technology</a></p>
       <p>1. the two articles both articulate an ethical problem related to their topic (industry-standard design tools & the current scale and state of open-source tech). define what you consider to be the authors positions in relation to these two topics and how they overlap. what connections can you draw between these two articles? do they prescribe solutions that are pertinent to each other? 
</p>
        <p>2. aside from the mastery of certain digital tools and programs, what skills do you see as integral to your graphic design practice?</p>
        
    <p>my reply</p>
    <p>in John-Patrick harnett's article, "The Programmed Designer", Harnett takes a bold stance against both Adobe and Apple; industry standard design "tools" that work so hard to reassure us of their ever lasting convenience and familiarity that we, as designers, create work bound by restrictions along with mediocre ui interaction with basically little to no complaints. the label of a "designer" is no longer self defined, now implied that if one doesn't use industry standard tools they are incomplete in their skill. graphic design today is no longer thought of as the actual human practice of creating and designing, but instead tasks to be completed on one designated platform to be sent to another designated platform and shared to another and so on and so forth. </p>
    <p>in Gavin Nueller's "Microsoft and the Yeoman Coders," Mueller writes about how integral open source code was historically; those interested in code learning from existing programs, software only making further developments because of this learning and sharing pool. there is the argument that sharing code and software effectively cheapens the industry, but todays high-tech commodified softwares were still privy to open source code in their creation! open source code was not meant to be an attack against capitalism, but instead a preservation of information to give anyone who would like to learn or grow in programming the opportunity to do so (even larger corporations and big tech!) 
    </p>
    <p>both articles overlap in their idea that unique, purely autonomous work can (and has!) been able to stay afloat without centralization. both prescribe a similar "solution," that we as designers should look towards open source tools and code and use them as resources rather than treating them like something foreign! 
    </p>
    <p>besides mastery of digital tools and programs, i feel as though having the ability to catch what exactly draws in a viewer to a piece/body of work is an important skill to have. i believe that this requires some intuition, but also a certain level of understanding of an audience, as well as the desire to create something "new" and exciting. i feel like the designers intuition is something that's really stifled by online tools.</p>

       <p>what do you think of Lialina’s definition of the universal user? do you think it is a useful category for understanding schwulst’s argument advocating for individual websites over platforms? explain why and provide at least 1 example. </p>
        <p>what kind of computer user are you? draw on concepts from Lialina’s text, and integrate a quotation in your answer. make use of metaphor, if you can, to describe your experience online (à la schwulst).</p>
        
    <p>my reply</p>
   <p>I believe that Lialina's definition of the universal user is intriguing as it takes the label of "user," and shifts it's meaning into a new definition that isn't exactly a positive representation of tech; the idea that technology really is a tool rather than some life changing, personified "experience." Lialina takes the idea of something being "universal," and applies it to humans and their general goals when engaging with tech. rather than being a person with an experience, you are becoming a user; using said technology regardless of the "experience" it's meant to bring, and achieving whatever goal or finishing whatever task you set out to do in the first place. it is the idea that we should not forget that we are in front of a screen, that we should be the ones taking advantage of technology rather than the other way around. i think that this is a useful category or means of understanding Schwult's argument because of the idea that it is individual users that make up the architecture of the web, that we as individuals need to recognize what technology can do for us and our universal purposes and use it in order to add to the worldwide makeup and variety that completes the web. if we don't recognize this, the web may as well just be one cohesive and consistent, visually unappealing, information filled blob. i think an example of this is Spotify's desktop app interface- which is often talked about online because of a feature it has that is not present on the ios/android app. the app's sole purpose is meant to be to listen to music and podcasts, but many users will often open up their computers to use it's special feature- a little tab on the interface that shows what your friends and followers have been recently listening to. Spotify has toyed with getting rid of this feature but is always met with an invisible crowd who urges them not to. i feel like this is an example of an app designed for one sole purpose slightly turning into something else entirely, almost becoming a social media platform! </p>
<p>I'd like to hope that i try to be a universal user when i can, but i have to admit that more often than not I am an invisible user. especially in class, I kind of go in with the mentality that "the less (i) think about source code, scripts, links and the web itself, the more creative," I can be. I find it really difficult to learn and step into new ways of creating if the one I've previously stuck with works for me, but I'm hoping to break away from that habit!</p>

      <p>a key part to generative design and code is pattern and routine. akin to a chess player, marking each move down, and keeping a trace of your decisions can prove useful for your own process and future making. as a designer, to know that there might be a variety of possibilities to a given situation, can aid our ways of observing by using tools in novel ways. in one series of work, Van Rossum looks to fundamentals of waveforms as a departure point and reference point for connecting an interface to affecting the parameters of a letterform. if the letters explode, so too would the speakers. find 1 unique example of a pattern in nature, that appears to be programmatic. post a visual of this pattern and describe how it is programmatic in nature. </p>
    <p>my reply</p>
   <p>one somewhat broad example of programmatic design in nature is the actual existence of carbon dating- the idea that we can peel something back layer by layer and actually use its physical form to define its exact origin point. i mostly looked at how this is present in rock and cave forms through focusing on smaller sections of the grand canyon. a specific form called "Shinumo Quartzite" is labeled a such because of the actual sandstone and quartz makeup of the rock, creating a really beautiful pattern in the rock itself. this is programmatic in nature because of the geological measures in place at each time period- the pattern formed based on the natural shifting of said measures as the years go by. Shinumo Quartzite is only one of the rock formations that come together to form the massive grand canyon formation, and each of these units have their own geological makeup that we are able to physically see and almost make a distinction of ourselves because of the patterns the sediment forms. I wanted to mention carbon dating because of the way Van Rossum looked to waveforms as a starting point for his design- carbon dating giving us even more information to complete the "program" of the way the formation was "written." </p>

       <p> assigned reading 1:<a href=" https://www.e-flux.com/journal/24/67860/in-free-fall-a-thought-experiment-on-vertical-perspective/"> https://www.e-flux.com/journal/24/67860/in-free-fall-a-thought-experiment-on-vertical-perspective</a></p>
<p>a major theme that runs throughout Steyerl’s essay is that of surveillance. in your own words, define surveillance and discuss how the notion of a “vertical” or aerial perspective lends itself to a culture of surveillance according to Steyerl’s thought experiment.  </p>
    <p>my reply</p>
   <p>in my own words, surveillance is a means of giving us a tangible view of abstract space that we were once only able to define through constructing 3d space around just ourselves. in other words, constructed surveillance not only allows us to see multiple, converging literal perspectives, but also worldviews that are completely separate from what is unique to our eyes. vertical/aerial perspective absolutely lends itself to surveillance due to the fact that satellite imagery is something that, at this moment in time, is physically impossible for us as humans to be able to personally view and perceive. however, it takes a personal effort to actually understand that yes, this is an image separate from what I am actually able to visually grasp, because of the fact that this view has now become so normalized and used to dictate where we are. along with that, this aerial imagery really only gives us an illusion of freedom, as while it is a vertical perspective, we physically are not "looking down" at anyone. the notion of superiority that is pushed with this aerial view is not ever given to us; it is given to the physical machine. we are never even given the physical position or even constructed option to look back up. so, while an aerial perspective can be something to be amazed by or to be used as a tool, it does kind of fall back to the traditional definition of surveillance- that we are being watched. we are no longer actually able to build and define our personal positions in space; whether or not that be metaphysical or literal, as it now and will forever be constructed for us. </p>
