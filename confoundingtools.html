<p>the confounding tools assignment brief states-</p>
<p> "design a 24” × 36” digital poster about your life under COVID 19 without using software explicitly intended for design. for your first project this semester, you will be tasked with developing a large-format 2D composition inspired by some aspect of your life under COVID19. how has it changed? what have you lost contact with? what have you gained contact with? think of ways to represent your life under current conditions. the poster must be 24” × 36” digital poster. you will conceive, develop, refine, print, and document the final artefact over the next two weeks.
    now here’s the catch: you are not allowed to use any adobe software or other software explicitly designed for print design and production in your process. you are free to use any other digital software against its grain. some possible avenues to explore: excel? word? screenshots? a video game? chat? a website? snap camera? sparkAR? google maps? twitch? the choice is yours. this poster does not have to be narrative-based. consider archive, metonymy, synecdoche, and process all as possible avenues to represent your topic."</p>

 <p>starting with week 1, we were tasked with brainstorming a couple ideas for non design mediums to use for the project. I had settled on three ideas; digitally collaging spotify album artwork into one composition using google docs and/or a scanner, editing email screenshots with apple’s preview into a blackout poetry esque composition, or light painting with everyday items such as a flat iron, microwave, and so on and so forth. after in class feedback, I chose to go with the blackout poetry idea.</p>

 <p>after week 1, I began editing my email screenshots, but felt as though it was getting a bit boring and restricting. so, during week 2, I started collecting screenshots of conversations in imessage, twitter, snapchat, and whatsApp, and started blacking out pieces in the conversations. I still felt as though this wasn’t really enough, so I asked my family to write notes about their covid experiences, and scanned these in to include in the composition. at this point, making my layout on my desktop seemed like the best option for editing with the least amount of restriction.</p>

<p>by week 3, it was just a matter of moving around the elements on my desktop for an interesting final composition. at this point I felt as though it was looking somewhat scrapbook-y, so I scanned in stickers to turn into folders on my desktop. </p>
