<p>
this assignment asks students to think critically about embodiment and their own embodied interactions with the digital tools and environments that populate their daily lives. students will engage in auto-ethnographic research by observing and documenting their firsthand experience of a particular digital interaction. the definition of “digital interaction” in this assignment is intentionally broad and ranges in complexity from scrolling through an Instagram feed to playing your favourite online game to something as simple as setting the digital clock on your microwave—all of these are ripe for critical reflection in regards to how our bodies mediate and actually inform the experience. on this topic, literary and media theorist N. Katherine Hayles wrote: certainly media are dependent on embodied subjects, not only for their reception and significance but also because researchers extensively investigate the precise nature of computer/human interfaces to develop and design networked and programmable media that will have certain effects. there would be no media without humans to invent them, and no purpose to them without humans to give them meaning and significance. — from My Mother Was A Computer, University of Chicago Press, 2005, p. 35. in other words, there is no programmed digital interaction too small that hasn’t been conceived and designed by and for the use of human bodies. consequently, we as designers must take this bodily part of the equation into consideration whenever we set out to create an interactive experience. the first (and easiest) place to start is to start observing ourselves and to record how we feel our way through the navigation of various digital tools and/or environments. documenting one's user. of course, none of this really matters in a design/development context unless we can take those personal, embodied interactions and effectively communicate them to a broader public. so, the second part of this assignment asks students to design an infographic that visualizes at least one kind of quantitative information and one kind of qualitative information about their experience in a single, unified compositional space, whether that be 2D, 3D or 4D. the crux of this second stage will be striking a balance not only between the two types of information but also the legibility of that information and the overarching goal of creating a dynamic and compelling piece of graphic design. for this assignment, a mixed media approach is encouraged to amplify the sensation of embodiment. for example: combining photography with vector illustration; animation in combination with expressive type on a webpage; video of a data visualization with voice-over narration. this list is incomplete, and unlisted combinations are welcome.

    <p>for the first stage of this assignment, we were tasked with coming up with a couple of ideas of what personal interaction could be measured to come up with an interesting infographic. I had three ideas:
        analyzing my selfie data; like what angles, why I’m taking the selfie, if I’m sending it to someone, how many I take how many I delete etc. </p>
<p>seeing how often I use my presto- like how much I load into it, how much each ride is worth based on distance, how many times I tap/transfer, etc. </p>
    <p>analyzing my tinder- either swiping right on every single person and seeing physically what kind of person is into me- or swiping genuinely to see what my ideal type is.</p>
<p>after presenting these ideas to the class, I settled on the tinder idea. </p>

    <div class= "stage2text">
<p> when I first started my design, my plan was to create a mock profile, just with the content adjusted to contain my data. this way, I felt like there would be a really strong association to the tinder aesthetic with just one glance at my infographic.</p>
<p>but, after in class critique, I realized that too much of an aesthetic association really caused the infographic to lose any personal aspect, and I decided I needed to redirect my visuals. </p>

<div class= "stage3text">
<p>at this point I began making illustrations heavily inspired by paper doll printouts, as I felt like the concept was a really great physical representation of piecing together my ideal type. </p>
<p>however, I was really unsure as to how I could represent the qualitative data if I were to go this route visually. after presenting what I had so far during crit, I realized if I were to shift my aesthetic to something like an online dress up game, it’d be much easier to display all my data.

    <p>for my completed graphic, I decided to go with a really tacky yet playful online website aesthetic, something like a dress up game you’d play in the 2000’s.</p>
